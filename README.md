# Coffee Friend
Grab a cup of coffee with a friend. Stop scrolling online.

I find that I'm spending a lot of time scrolling the web. It's not good. I'd
prefer to have a 2 minute conversation with an actual person over the phone,
or meet up with someone over a cup of coffee for 30 minutes.

It's just too hard without help because it feels weird to message people on
Facebook uninvited. When people are busy with their daily lives, it feels
like I'm pestering to ask over and over and because they're usually busy I
usually hear "no." The problem is, my friends want to hang out. The gaps in
our schedules just rarely line up, and checking when they don't is tedious.

Coffee friend makes it easier to have a 2-minute chat or to grab a cup of
coffee with friends. It lets you know when people in your friend group are
open, and gives you a more natural platform to talk casually when you're
free.
